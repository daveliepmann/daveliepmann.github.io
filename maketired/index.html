      <p><strong>make tired</strong> is an iPhone and iPad app that creates short, intense workouts to make you tired after strength training.</p>
      <p>Use the app after your regular strength training to generate a random cardio-conditioning workout. Workouts range from 5 to 20 minutes. Use <strong>make tired</strong> alongside strength programs like 5/3/1 and GreySkull LP to get the most out of your training.</p>
      <p>The workouts scale to your ability level and include exercise descriptions. You can toggle the basic equipment, including a pull-up bar, dip bars, a place to run, and dumbbells. The workouts in the app are not appropriate for people who are unable to hang from a pull-up bar for at least fifteen seconds.</p>
